If there is anything else we should know about your work on this assignment, please
explain here:
 
In this lab, I created a Server class to handle multiple connections from the clients.
Once a new connection is found, it will create a new thread which executes NetworkView's run().
Thus in the Main(), it will create new Server instead of new NetworkView.

In the client, I created methods to enable user to alter the Weasley Clock. Details can be found 
in the Client.java. Besides, whenever client sends a command to the server, that command will 
start with '$', the server will then check the start sign of each command it receives and then begins 
to process the command.

In the Server, I added some protocols. Thus after receiving a command which has start sign '$', 
it will begin to process the command. If the command starts with "addPerson + name", the server will only
add that new person if the person name provided by the client is valid and there is no such person already existed 
in the people list. Same rule for the command "addLoc + location name". When the command starts with "dropPerson + name", 
it will only drop that person if such person does exist in the current people list and it is not the only one person 
in the people list. Same rule for the command "dropLocation + location name". Besides, after processing the command, the 
server will send the reply to tell the client whether that command works or not. 

Test Plan:
I first run Main.java(Server) and then run Gui.java(Client) 3 times to create 3 connections to the server.
Then I add person/location randomly, providing or not providing the names, or providing duplicate names.
Then I drop person/location randomly, providing a name exsisted or not existed in the current name lists.

What does a client do if the response to a "query name" command is a name it hasn't seen before?
Display an error message to tell the user the command didn't work.

Will your new server/client combination pass the JUnit tests of Lab W?
After some modifications in the weasley.java, it passes the JUnit tests for Lab W.
