If there is anything else we should know about your work on this assignment, please
explain here: 
For lab4a, I created a graphical user interface for the client side. 
In the Gui, clicking the start button will create a separated thread to execute the run() method in
the client side. In the run() method of the client, the client will send queries to the server, then
it will update the display of the Gui by the responses from the server. I removed the main method which 
existed in the client class since it will no longer be used. Besides, I declared final variables to make 
the Gui codes more readable. I also used scrollable JList, JTextPane to display information of people, locations 
and people's locations. Thus, the number of locations and people are flexible.
