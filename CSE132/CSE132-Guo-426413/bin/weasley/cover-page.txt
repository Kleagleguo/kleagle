Security Issues Comments:
1. I can create a password to authenticate the sender of the request

2. I can create a list which contains the name of the requestors that 
are allowed to know my information or allowed to set the location.

3. Yes, I think it would be safer to have each model be Person-specific.
Because if we store all the person information in one model, once security
is broken, all the information could be lost.
