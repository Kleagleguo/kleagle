********************************
* Tell us about your protocol: *
********************************
I used the same protocol as the one provided in the instruction page(http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~roger/132/Labs/5a/setprotocol.html).

Besides, I added one message type:
case 100: - hint message
- The server tells all the clients that a hint has been given

The server will receive messages sent from the client in the playerHandler class, since it is a multiplayer
game, each player will be allocated one playerHandler. In the playerHandler, when specific type of message
is received, the playerHandler will call corresponding method in the GameController.

I made the client a runnable, so in the run() method in the client, I used it to receive messages sent from
server. When specific type of message is received from the server, the client will call corresponding method
to control the display of the gui.

1.How to start the game: 
The Game will only start after 3 players have joined the game. 
Hence to run the game in the local host, just do as follows :)   
(1) run the GameController(will start the server).

(2) run the Gui(start the client and its interface), after the Gui shows up, click the "start the game"
button, enter player's name, then you will be waiting for other players to join if there are less than 
3 players in the game.

(3) repeat step (2) until 3 players join the game and have clicked the start button, then game starts!

2.What will happen during the game:
There will be two hints given during the game. The hint will simply show one more additional column of 
cards for players to select. There will be 2 hints in total. 

A hint timer will start working after the game starts, the two hints will both be given after 60 seconds if
no one has played a set.

3.When will the game ends: 
(1) There is a timer in the game. After the game starts(i.e., the cards have been dealt on the table),
the timer will start working, if 10 mins passed, there are still cards in the card deck(i.e, the 3 
players were to slow to play all the valid sets), the game will be forced to end, and the player with
the highest score wins the game. 

(2) If there is no cards in the card deck(i.e, there is no more card to deal), the player with the 
highest score wins the game.
