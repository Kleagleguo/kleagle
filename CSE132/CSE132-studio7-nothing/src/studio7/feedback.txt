1) What display format(s) did you decide to support in ViewInputStream and ViewOutputStream?
Hex, Decimal, ASCII

2) Describe your revised protocol.
to add a location, we add the option to send a UTF "newloc" and that will be read by the server, causing the server to read a string 
from the client(the name of a location to be added), and then the server adds that location to the model. Addperson is similar, but
it sends the UTF "newper". same goes for Removing("remper ad remloc"), though this will be able to send back "person not even there" 
it's all just adding the option for a client to send a request to change the model, the server accepting, and then the essential info
bein exchanged

3) Comments about this studio (will you will use these tools to improve the observability of your sockets code)?
This was a good studio, showed us how to work with input and outputstreams more visibly. I think it'll be useful for seeing what goes wrong.
