Sarah started on the wrong track
And she was always seeking shelter
Johnny was an insomniac
And no one loved him more than Sarah

Gone, they were gone, and the bridges burnin'
Wrong, they were wrong, and the wheels are turnin'
Over and over, they keep on learning
They're gonna make it through

Never say never
Nothing lasts forever
Life could be much better
But you have to just let go
Never say never
There's nothing to be scared of
And you don't have to give up
On something you don't know
Oh, no, no

They sold a Chevy for a Cadillac
Because a Cadillac looks better
They never bothered ever looking back
Because they thought they'd live forever

Gone, they were gone, and the bridges burnin'
Wrong, they were wrong, and the wheels are turnin'
Over and over, they keep on learning
They're gonna make it through

Never say never
Nothing lasts forever
Life could be much better
But you have to just let go
Never say never
There's nothing to be scared of
And you don't have to give up
On something you don't know

Well you're right back where you started
Sitting all alone
And this ain't what you wanted
You just let go

Never, never
Oh, never say never

Oh, yeah, yeah
No, never
Never say never

Oh, never
Nothing lasts forever
Life could be much better
But you have to just let go
Never say never
There's nothing to be scared of
And you don't have to give up
On something you don't know

Never... never...
Oh, never say never
