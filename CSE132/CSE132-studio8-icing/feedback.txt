Comments/feedback about this studio.  What design decisions did you make?
1. Layout
So there should be a minimum of 12 cards, and there should be room for 9 more. The cards will be displayed
in 3 card tall columns. The user should be able to select up to three cards at a time, and selecting a card
should make it look visibly different(perhaps a yellow outline). 
Initially, there should be a waiting area screen where you determine how many people you'd like to play with
(from a drop menu with 1-4 being the options), you type a name you'd like into a textfield, and then you push 
a start button to indicate you're ready to play a game. Pushing the start button makes other buttons 
unpushable, and the cards will be displayed once the game starts. The start button and drop menu disappear 
when the game starts. When the game ends, the winner is displayed in a popup(player 1 wins!), and the cards disappear. 
The original waiting area appears again at the end of the game so that you can join another game.
2.Client vs Server
Server- should have a model of a deck of set cards, as well as keep track of which ones are on the table, 
their positions, and all possible sets on the table(which it'll check as cards are added). IF there are
no sets, the server will deal three cards. The server should also keep track of the names of the players, and
their points. It will respond to requests of what cards are on the table, and keep track of players scores. It
will also respond to requests of "are these three cards a set?", and change players' scores accordingly. Once
a set has been matched, it is removed from the table and all sets containing those 3 cards are removed from the
set of sets. Assuming cards left in the deck, card will be added to ensure a minimum of 12 cards on the table,
and then will be added until at least one set can be formed.
Client- should have pictures of the set of cards. The client sends the request to start, to get the other players
names/scores, to get the cards on the table, and to send in a possible set.
There should be an agreed protocol where, if the client requests the standard things in the run method the server
can respond to say the game is over and who has won or lost.
If a server gets an illegal command from the client, it should kick the client from the game. And give them a
score of -3. It will also change their name to scumbag.\\
