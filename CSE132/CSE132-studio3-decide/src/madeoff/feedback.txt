Point 6.  What does "final" mean and why do you have to use it for local 
     variables that are referenced by inner classes? Final means the variable cannot be changed.
     It is used by the inner classes because since multiple threads are running simultaneously the
     variables within must not be altered.  

Point 10. What is the difference between ".run()" and ".start()"
.run() just runs the method on the main thread, whereas .start() runs the .run() method on a newly invoked thread.

Points 12 and 13. 
   How did your application behave when you introduced ".start()" for the
   transactions?  How did its running time change?  How did its output change?
   Initially, when .start() was introduced the final total balance did not match the initial total. The runtime was faster.
   The output changed to have a different total balance among all accounts. 

Point 15.  What happens when you made all the methods synchronized?  Why did you
   see that behavior? It deadlocked because two synchronized methods were being called within another synchronized method. 

   What happens when you make only the "transfer" method synchronized?
   Someone Madeoff with some money. This does not specify that the withdraw and deposit methods are synchronized,
   and therefore money was lost. 

   Which methods should be synchronized, and why?
   withdraw() and deposit() should be synchronized so that for each withdraw there is a deposit into 
   another (or the same) account. We do not want the withdraw and deposit methods to overlap.
   This is important so that the final total balance is equal to the initial total.
